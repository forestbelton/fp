fp
==

I don't really have anything to say quite yet about this project. fp is an API that implements a decimal floating-point format with up to 14 digits of precision.

Supported operations
--------------------
* Basic arithmetic (+, -, *, /)
* Polynomial evaluation using the Horner scheme
* Conversion operations to/from various data types (WIP)

Planned features
----------------
* Basic trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
* Exponential functions (exp, pow, log, sqrt)
